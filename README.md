# Automated Testing for NopCommerce Features

## Introduction

We aim to build an automation project that executes every night at 12:00 AM, generates reports, and provides them. Currently, we want to cover two features: Registration and PlaceOrder.

## Additional Functionalities

- Automation projects should be capable of running on different OS platforms.
- Use any preferred automation framework (e.g., Selenium, Cypress).
- Choose a framework that supports the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern.
- Utilize test reporting tools (e.g., Extent Report, Allure report).
- Feel free to use any data provider (e.g., Excel, CSV).
- Use your imagination to write additional tests if they cover other important functionalities.

Remember, the more comprehensive, the better! üòè
